    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Eun Mi. I am from South Korea and currently reside in Melbourne. I met and married an amazing Australian man in Korea and migrated to Australia ten years ago. Back in Korea, I received a Bachelor of Arts, specialising in literature, and worked at one of the biggest retail companies there for ten years. Since I moved to Australia, I have been working at an online security company as an authentication analyst.</p>
    <p>Moving to Australia was the best decision of my life. I fell in love with Australia’s nature and enjoy exploring the outback and bush camping. I have developed a passion for wild animals, especially koalas, and one of my dreams is to work at a Koala conservation centre. Apart from the fantastic nature, I also became hooked on AFL and cricket. I am probably the only Korean who loves test-match cricket. My favourite player is Steve Smith.  For AFL, I am a big Melbourne Demons fan. Listening to music is also one of my pastimes: I enjoy 80-90's music, including everything from Michael Jackson to Guns N' Roses.</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT began when I started working at an online security company. My current role is as an authentication analyst, verifying and validating clients’ information for the purpose of issuing SSL certificates, such as domain ownership, employment status, and organisation registration. Though I started this role without any IT knowledge or experiences, I have been successful. Over a couple of years, I became more and more interested in the specific industry I am in, cybersecurity. I have continuously developed troubleshooting and critical thinking skills to move forward in my career. I found myself enjoying and excelling in problem-solving and collaborating with cross-functional teams such as tech support, project managers and engineers. I have had many ideas and suggestions on how to improve the customers’ portal and enhance internal tools; however, my lack of IT knowledge and basic technical skills is often a hurdle from progressing beyond my current role and communicating with IT professionals. Following IT trends and understanding the IT industry with some technical skills seems crucial to my career development.</p>
    <p>I was searching for an introductory IT course in OUA and found several available courses. Compared to other universities’ offerings, RMIT provided precise subject details, and the topics covered were what I was after. Furthermore, RMIT has an excellent reputation and is one of the world’s leading universities, especially in IT and engineering. Some of my friends who studied at RMIT gave a lot of positive feedback as well, and it made me want to experience what it will be like to study at RMIT and be a part of the university community.</p>
    <p>This course is the first entry requirement course for an IT degree, and it was a perfect start for someone like me who lacks IT knowledge and experience. Before progressing to advanced technical skills, I would like first to understand the IT industry’s foundations. I expect to learn a broad range of IT concepts and contemporary technologies that might help me determine the direction in which I would like to progress and provide me with an understanding of the required skills. I also expect to learn a little bit of project management working in a team, such as building a concept, planning, and executing in an IT context.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <h3>Cyber Security Analyst</h3>
  <h3><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51692457?type=standout#searchRequestToken=074d8780-23d2-479f-ad68-60cd1a51f7f8" target="_blank">See Job Ad here!</a></h3>
  <img src="ideal job.jpg" alt="Cyber Security Analyst">

  <p> <span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Description:</span>Cyber Security Analysts are responsible for the overall company’s systems and networks safety. They make sure networks and systems are protected from any malicious attacks. In this particular job ad, the responsibilities include monitoring and investigating any security incidents, conducting IT audits to ensure ongoing operational IT compliance, and participating in various security management processes. Working at an online security company for several years, I have learned how critical cybersecurity is. As more business go online these days, we see more crimes go online as well. For example, last year, under COVID, I saw more phishing attacks, and criminals are becoming better at deceiving people. As we are using more IT technologies in our daily lives, protecting our data and information is becoming more crucial. The importance of cybersecurity will only get bigger and bigger. Cyber Security Analysts will protect people and make the cyber world secure and safe, which makes this career appealing to me.</p>
  <p><span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Skills I need:</span>To be a Cyber Security Analyst, you are required to have a Bachelor's degree in an IT-related field, such as information technology, computer science, or cybersecurity. Internship experience in the cybersecurity area would help, but one can also start his or her career in any IT industry area and move up to a cybersecurity role to obtain broad experience in various areas. Analysing and investigating all security events in systems and networks, one would need to possess a broad understating of a range of IT technologies. Not only soft skills but some technical skills will be required, including Network Security, Information systems, Cryptography, Python and Vulnerability assessment. Some certifications would be beneficial, such as CISSP (A Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and CISA (A Certified Information Systems Auditor).  Other general skills are also required, such as communication, problem-solving, organisation, and teamwork skills. These skills will be essential in working in a group and interacting with the management team or clients.</p>
  <p><span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Skills I have:</span>At this moment,I do not have any of the technical skills or qualifications needed to become a Cyber Security Analyst. I have seven years of working experience in a security company as an authentication analyst. My role is not technical, but the experience and knowledge in digital security such as PKI and TLS/SSL certificates will help me progress my career. I also have management and organisation skills from experience managing the team for day-to-day operation.</p>
  <p><span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Learning plan:</span>As a first step to becoming a Cyber Security Analyst, I have signed up for the ‘Introduction to Information Technology’ course at RMIT. Having a bachelor’s degree in IT will be fundamental to this role. Throughout the bachelor course over the four years, I expect to learn some of the required technical skills. While I am studying, I will keep working at my current company, and there might be a chance for me to challenge myself in this role.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TYPE:	Assertive Defender </li>
  <li>CODE:	ISFJ-A </li>
  <li>ROLE:	Sentinel </li>
  <li>STRATEGY:	Confident Individualism</li>
</ul>
<img src="Myers-Brigs Type Indicator2.jpg" alt="Myers-Brigs Type Indicator1">
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Type: Assertive Defender</span></p>
<p><span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Strengths)
Supportive/ Reliable and Patient / Imaginative and Observant / Enthusiastic / Loyal and Hard-Working / Good Practical Skills :</span>
Defenders are the universal helpers, sharing their knowledge, experience, time and energy with anyone who needs it. Defender personalities are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. Defenders take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home.
</p>
<p><span style="color:midnightblue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Weaknesses)
Humble and Shy / Take Things Too Personally / Repress Their Feelings / Overload Themselves / Reluctant to Change / Too Altruistic
 :</span>
Defenders are conservative, sensitive and shy to express themselves as they are so concerned with others’ feelings that they refuse to make their thoughts known. Defenders have trouble separating personal and impersonal situations. Being such warm, good-natured people, Defenders are willing to let things slide, to believe that things will get better soon, to not burden others by accepting their offers of help, while their troubles mount unassisted.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Role: Sentinel</span></p>
<p>Sentinels are cooperative, practical, and grounded. Careful and consistent, Sentinel personalities tend to be self-motivated. This means that they rarely need external inspiration to be productive and focused. They work hard and aim never to let anyone down.
Sentinel personalities thrive in environments that have clear hierarchies and rules. Whether or not they’re in a formal leadership role, they care about setting a good example.
</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Strategies: Confident Individualism</span></p>
<p>Confident Individualists tend to trust in themselves. They enjoy their own company and don’t mind spending time alone to pursue their interests. They are motivated by their inner world rather than outside expectations. They’re opinionated, but they aren’t excessively worried about what others think.</p>

  <img src="Honey and Mumford.jpg" alt="Honey and Mumford">
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Theorist style</span></p>
<p>Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity, and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories. They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational order. They are often keen on basic assumptions, principles, theories, models and systems thinking. </p>

<h3><a href="https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz" target="_blank">3.	Leadership Style</a></h3>
  <img src="Leadership Style.jpg" alt="Leadership Style">
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;">Servant Leader</span></p>
<p>For you, others come first. Your need to serve means that you share power, and delight in seeing others grow. You are happy when you help others become self-actualized. Ethical priorities help you remember the responsibilities of leadership. Your humility informs your interactions with others and helps you remain conscientious. As a natural listener, you know how to build a community. </p>

<h3>My reflection on test results...</h3>
<p>It was fun to take these tests, but I was initially somewhat doubtful whether they could adequately assess me with questionnaires only. However, the results completely surprised me with the level of detail provided in each assessment. They made me reflect upon myself at work and my personal life, and I realised the results were quite accurate. Now I understand the value of tests and how reliable they are, given that a lot of questions were based on legitimate psychological assessments</p>
<p>The results provided me with valuable information, analysing my strengths and weaknesses in personality, learning style and leadership style. These results mean a lot to me as I can utilise them to navigate various areas, including work, friends, and even romantic relationships. The test results will give me some ideas about working in a team more efficiently in the upcoming group project. They will guide me in ascertaining what kind of role I might be suitable for, how I can contribute, what can motivate me, how to solve conflicts, and which areas I need to improve. For example, I might not be a leader, but as a defender type, I might be a good coordinator among members, helping others by being supportive, reliable, patient, and empathetic. As per the leadership test results, I am a good listener and will contribute to creating a good community. My learning style tests suggest I am a Theorist and can contribute to rational and logical thought processes. Understanding my personality and learning style can help me maximise my strengths and find the most efficient way to collaborate with the team. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the results of the tests made me more open-minded to others. I understand every individual is different and unique, and the tests made me consider certain personality types in a more positive light; everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and there will be a role fitting to every member. By sharing our personal profiles, we will be able to understand individual work styles, preferences, and personalities, which will help reduce the time used in deciding our roles and assignments. This will also assist in resolving potential conflicts among members, as the test results allow us to predict how different people will interact in the group, the real source of conflicts, and the best approach to adopt for each member. Understanding myself and others with the help of tests will be critical to our success as a team.</p>
