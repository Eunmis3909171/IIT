    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Eun Mi. I am from South Korea and currently reside in Melbourne. I met and married an amazing Australian man in Korea and migrated to Australia ten years ago. Back in Korea, I received a Bachelor of Arts, specialising in literature, and worked at one of the biggest retail companies there for ten years. Since I moved to Australia, I have been working at an online security company as an authentication analyst.</p>
    <p>Moving to Australia was the best decision of my life. I fell in love with Australia’s nature and enjoy exploring the outback and bush camping. I have developed a passion for wild animals, especially koalas, and one of my dreams is to work at a Koala conservation centre. Apart from the fantastic nature, I also became hooked on AFL and cricket. I am probably the only Korean who loves test-match cricket. My favourite player is Steve Smith.  For AFL, I am a big Melbourne Demons fan. Listening to music is also one of my pastimes: I enjoy 80-90's music, including everything from Michael Jackson to Guns N' Roses.</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT began when I started working at an online security company. My current role is as an authentication analyst, verifying and validating clients’ information for the purpose of issuing SSL certificates, such as domain ownership, employment status, and organisation registration. Though I started this role without any IT knowledge or experiences, I have been successful. Over a couple of years, I became more and more interested in the specific industry I am in, cybersecurity. I have continuously developed troubleshooting and critical thinking skills to move forward in my career. I found myself enjoying and excelling in problem-solving and collaborating with cross-functional teams such as tech support, project managers and engineers. I have had many ideas and suggestions on how to improve the customers’ portal and enhance internal tools; however, my lack of IT knowledge and basic technical skills is often a hurdle from progressing beyond my current role and communicating with IT professionals. Following IT trends and understanding the IT industry with some technical skills seems crucial to my career development.</p>
    <p>I was searching for an introductory IT course in OUA and found several available courses. Compared to other universities’ offerings, RMIT provided precise subject details, and the topics covered were what I was after. Furthermore, RMIT has an excellent reputation and is one of the world’s leading universities, especially in IT and engineering. Some of my friends who studied at RMIT gave a lot of positive feedback as well, and it made me want to experience what it will be like to study at RMIT and be a part of the university community.</p>
    <p>This course is the first entry requirement course for an IT degree, and it was a perfect start for someone like me who lacks IT knowledge and experience. Before progressing to advanced technical skills, I would like first to understand the IT industry’s foundations. I expect to learn a broad range of IT concepts and contemporary technologies that might help me determine the direction in which I would like to progress and provide me with an understanding of the required skills. I also expect to learn a little bit of project management working in a team, such as building a concept, planning, and executing in an IT context.</p>
