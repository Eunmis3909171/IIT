    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Eun Mi. I am from South Korea and currently reside in Melbourne. I met and married an amazing Australian man in Korea and migrated to Australia ten years ago. Back in Korea, I received a Bachelor of Arts, specialising in literature, and worked at one of the biggest retail companies there for ten years. Since I moved to Australia, I have been working at an online security company as an authentication analyst.</p>
    <p>Moving to Australia was the best decision of my life. I fell in love with Australiaâ€™s nature and enjoy exploring the outback and bush camping. I have developed a passion for wild animals, especially koalas, and one of my dreams is to work at a Koala conservation centre. Apart from the fantastic nature, I also became hooked on AFL and cricket. I am probably the only Korean who loves test-match cricket. My favourite player is Steve Smith.  For AFL, I am a big Melbourne Demons fan. Listening to music is also one of my pastimes: I enjoy 80-90's music, including everything from Michael Jackson to Guns N' Roses.</p>
